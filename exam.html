          <h3>Newsletter form and labels</h3>
          <p>
            This website was missing a form validation on the newsletter signup on the footer. It was also missing a
            label in the input. Both have been added to fix this issue. When the form passes with a valid email address
            the user will be notified with a message, telling them that they have signed up. There was also a missplaced
            label in my contact form. That have now also been dealt with. Every label is now connected with their
            inputs.

          <h3>Updated my header</h3>
          <p>
            My header looked good on every screen on my "index.html", because it had good contrast with my banner image.
            Although on other pages the header blends in with the other content since the background is also white. To
            fix this issue I added some shadow underneath my header to fix this issue. I think it looks neat and works.

          <h3>Removed console.logs</h3>
          <p>
            I've cleaned up some of my code and also removed the console.logs. By removing the console.logs it makes it
            easier to read the full code, because they are only useful while testing.

          <h3>Global styles</h3>
          <p>
            There was a lot of repeated CSS on every stylesheet for this project. With considering the DRY principles I
            have now changed that, and made the code even more cleaner. I created a global stylesheet for every page,
            which made the code much cleaner and neat. I also cleaned up some code for better media quiries for every
            screen.

          <h3>Font sizes</h3>
          <p>
            I have updated the font size on the blog page to make it more readable. Used to be 12px now its 14px. On the
            contact page I updated the error message to be bigger also, because they we're only 10px. Everything should
            be more readable now.

          <h3>Headings</h3>
          <p>
            My logo for my website was wrapped in a "h1" which is not the best solution for SEO, and for users to easier
            understand what the page is about. Now all pages have a unique h1 that describes the page. Every header tags
            should now be inn correct order from "h1" to "h6".

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            Travezy was my last project for my first year of coding. I was happy with the design I came up with and
            everything came together well. This was the hardest project so far, because there a lot of javascript I
            didn't knew how to solve. I tried to make the carousel even better before delivering this Portfolio. One of
            the things I tried to do was to show only one blog post on a smaller screen. I tried different codes, but I
            didn't get it to work this time. There was so much little time to figure this out. I only got it to work
            when I refreshed the page on a smaller screen size. By doing this project I really learned a lot, and I will
            keep improving my HTML, CSS and JS. Overall happy with the end result and my first year of coding.
