          <h3>Contact form</h3>
          <p>
            I have added a contact form validation for my semester project. Since there was no javascript on this
            project at first, i though this was needed for the website. To make the form passes the user have to type in
            minimum 5 characters for the first name, exact 8 numbers for the phone number, and at last type in a valid
            email asdress. If every requirements passes the users will notified with a box telling them that the
            messsage has been sent. Furthermore I have added a easy description on what the users needs to type at first
            to make less confusion about the form.

          <h3>Removing head element</h3>
          <p>
            When I delivered this project I had two head elements in my HTML document. I don't know how this happend at
            first, but this a mistake I didn't see at the time. The other head element has been removed and fixed.

          <h3>Fixing buttons</h3>
          <p>
            On this project every button was a children of anchor elements. I have now learned that buttons should only
            be used for functionality purposes. On that thought I removed all the buttons and styled them as an anchor
            tag instead and cleaned up some code for the different screens.

          <h3>Global styles / white spaces / Main</h3>
          <p class="text">
            There was a lot of repeated CSS on every stylesheet for this project. With considering the DRY principles I
            have now changed that, and made the code even more cleaner. I created a global stylesheet for every page,
            which made the code much cleaner and neat. Also it was some files on this project that had some whitespaces
            in them. Every file should now have been cleaned up, and there should be no unwanted errors.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my index html file there was a mix-up between a main and section element. Main element was a descendant
            of section elements. I have fixed cleaned this up and fixed this problem

          <h3>Loader</h3>
          <p>
            I considered to add a loader for this website as well, but decided not to add it, because everything on the
            page loads instantly. Also there is no API content which could take some time load.

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            This was my first project I really felt that did a good job on, and I was happy about the end result. I made
            some mistakes in my coding, but I think also there is good to make some mistakes, because I can learn from
            them and not make the same mistakes on my future projects. Some mistakes that I did have been cleaned up and
            I will remember them. I also added some functionality to the website, since we didn't learn about javascript
            at that time. Overall happy with the end result.
